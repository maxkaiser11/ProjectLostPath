Characters will be provided in spritesheet format (5x19), with each frame being 80x80 pixels.
These characters will also be fully customizable! 
Clothing, accessories, and weapons will be their own sprite sheet so that you can mix-and-match items and overlay them within your game. 
Because it's set up in a specific way, here's a little guide:

- The spritesheets are organized in "layers", determined by the number on the respective folder
- These layers are numbered 01-09, 01 being the very TOP layer, whilst 09 being the very BOTTOM
- Layers are set up so that you can mix-and-match 1 of each layer (one from each folder) for ultimate customization!

If you don't need this extra customization, I've exported Example Characters that you can use in your game.

If you have any questions about which animation is which, I've provided a Spritesheet Guide in this folder!
If you would like to modify any of these sprites, I've also included the Characters.aseprite file
